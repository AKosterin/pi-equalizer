# piEqualizer
An audio visualizer for the Raspberry Pi Sense Hat's LED display, written in Python.

Work in progress, not functional yet.

Done:
* function to update 1 column of LEDs at a time
* extracting audio data to create the audio spectrum
* making the spectrum into meaningful values (volume over 8 frequency ranges)
* feeding the values to the LEDs for displaying

Currently working on:
* playing audio and extracting data in real time

Later:
* making the display eye-pleasing
